# Wolfenstein3D
#### Clone Wolfenstein33d game with raycasting

In this project, I tried to implement the raycasting technology with which the original Wulfinstein 3D was written.
This demo version accepts a map with the .wulf extension.
Next, the map is checked for validity, minor errors are eliminated automatically. Then the map is displayed. Then the map is displayed.
The game has the ability to move, change the texture of the walls at the game, and player also can speed up his movespeed. Collision with walls also works.
The project was written in accordance with the C coding standard.
The project was tested on Mac OS.
